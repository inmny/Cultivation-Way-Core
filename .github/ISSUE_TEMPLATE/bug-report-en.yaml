        ## Thank you for reporting a bug!
        ## Here are some notes, please read them carefully so that we can process it more easily.

        ### ❗ | Make sure that no ISSUE with the same problem has been raised.
        ### 🌎| Please fill in the environment information accurately.
        ### ❔ | Provide at least 10 seconds of complete log content before and after the problem occurs. Please delete personal information and sensitive content in the log by yourself.
        ### If you don't know how to express it effectively and accurately, we recommend that you read "How to ask questions"

        #### Find the log file in Windows
        
        1. Enter C:/Users/user-name/AppData/LocalLow/mkarpenko/WorldBox in the path bar of the file explorer and press `Enter`. Where user-name is your computer username, you need to replace it yourself.
        2. Find the file named "Player.log", right-click and select "Open with" -> "Notepad".
        3. Press `Ctrl` + `A` to select all the content in Notepad, and then press `Ctrl` + `C` to copy all the content.
        4. Fill in the "Logging" column below, and be sure to delete personal information and sensitive content in it.
        
        #### Find the log file in Arch Linux with Wayland
        
        1. `~/.config/unity3d/mkarpenko/WorldBox/Player.log`. You should know how to find and open it.
        2. Fill in the "Logging" column below, and be sure to delete personal information and sensitive content in it.

        ### Find the log file in MacOS

        1. I don't know how to find it, please help to supplement
